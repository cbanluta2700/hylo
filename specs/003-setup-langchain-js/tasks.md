# Tasks: LangChain.js Multi-LLM Routing Infrastructure

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-setup-langchain-js/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: TypeScript 5.x, LangChain.js, Vite, Vercel Edge Runtime, LangSmith
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: LLMProvider, RoutingRule, APIKeyPool entities
   → contracts/api.yaml: /llm/route, /llm/providers, /llm/health endpoints
   → research.md: Query complexity classification, API key rotation
   → quickstart.md: Integration scenarios and test data
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: TypeScript config, LangChain.js dependencies, Edge Runtime setup
   → Tests: Contract tests for 3 API endpoints, integration scenarios
   → Core: Provider abstractions, routing engine, fallback chains
   → Integration: LangSmith tracing, provider health monitoring
   → Polish: Performance optimization, error handling, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files/providers = mark [P] for parallel
   → Shared routing files = sequential
   → Contract tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Dependencies: Setup → Tests → Core → Integration → Polish
```

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked before considering tasks complete_

- [x] All contracts (4 endpoints) have corresponding tests (T006-T009)
- [x] All entities (4 main types) have model tasks (T017-T020)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T006-T016 before T017+)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared state)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Critical TDD flow enforced: Tests fail first, then implement
- [x] Provider abstractions properly separated
- [x] Edge Function endpoints properly isolated
- [x] Frontend integration planned but not blocking backend

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run simultaneously
- **Verify tests fail** before implementing to ensure TDD compliance
- **Commit after each task** for proper change tracking
- **Edge Functions** have specific constraints: 128MB memory, <150ms cold start
- **LangChain.js** integration requires proper provider abstractions
- **Constitutional compliance** verified through structured approach
