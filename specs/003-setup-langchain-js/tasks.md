# Tasks: LangChain.js Multi-LLM Routing Infrastructure

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-setup-langchain-js/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: TypeScript 5.x, React 18, LangChain.js, Vite, Vercel Edge Runtime
   → Structure: Web app (frontend + backend edge functions)
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: LLMProvider, RoutingRule, APIKeyPool, RequestContext entities
   → contracts/: api.yaml with 4 endpoints, api.test.ts with contract tests
   → research.md: LangChain.js integration patterns, provider rotation strategy
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Edge functions, LangChain.js dependencies, environment
   → Tests: Contract tests (4 endpoints), integration tests (7 scenarios)
   → Core: Provider abstractions, routing engine, observability
   → Integration: LangSmith tracing, API key management
   → Polish: Error handling, performance optimization
4. Apply task rules:
   → Provider modules = [P] (different files)
   → Routing engine = sequential (shared state)
   → Contract tests = [P] (independent endpoints)
5. TDD order: Tests before implementation
6. Dependencies: Models → Services → Edge Functions → Integration
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md web app structure:

- **Backend**: `api/` directory for Vercel Edge Functions
- **Frontend**: `src/` directory for React components
- **Types**: Shared TypeScript interfaces
- **Tests**: `tests/` directory with contract/integration subdirs

## Phase 3.1: Setup

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked before considering tasks complete_

- [x] All contracts (4 endpoints) have corresponding tests (T006-T009)
- [x] All entities (4 main types) have model tasks (T017-T020)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T006-T016 before T017+)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared state)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Critical TDD flow enforced: Tests fail first, then implement
- [x] Provider abstractions properly separated
- [x] Edge Function endpoints properly isolated
- [x] Frontend integration planned but not blocking backend

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run simultaneously
- **Verify tests fail** before implementing to ensure TDD compliance
- **Commit after each task** for proper change tracking
- **Edge Functions** have specific constraints: 128MB memory, <150ms cold start
- **LangChain.js** integration requires proper provider abstractions
- **Constitutional compliance** verified through structured approach
