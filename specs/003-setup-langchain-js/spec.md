# Feature Specification: LangChain.js Multi-LLM Routing Infrastructure

**Feature Branch**: `003-setup-langchain-js`  
**Created**: September 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Setup LangChain.js multi-LLM routing infrastructure with Cerebras, Gemini, and Groq providers, API key rotation, and basic fallback chains"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Multi-LLM routing system with specific providers (Cerebras, Gemini, Groq)
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Travel AI system, External LLM providers, End users
   ‚Üí Actions: Route requests, Rotate API keys, Handle failures, Provide fallbacks
   ‚Üí Data: Travel queries, LLM responses, API credentials, Request logs
   ‚Üí Constraints: Provider quotas, rate limits, cost optimization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific routing strategy criteria]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: API key rotation frequency and triggers]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: System routes travel queries to optimal LLM provider
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Provider abstraction, intelligent routing, fallback handling
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí LLM Providers, Routing Rules, API Keys, Request Context
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Remove implementation details, focus on business value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a Hylo travel planning user, when I submit a complex travel query, the system should automatically route my request to the most appropriate AI provider based on query complexity, provider availability, and cost considerations, ensuring I receive high-quality travel recommendations even if some AI providers are unavailable.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a complex multi-destination travel query, **When** the user submits their request, **Then** the system routes to the most capable provider (Cerebras) and returns comprehensive travel recommendations
2. **Given** a simple travel preference query, **When** the user submits their request, **Then** the system routes to the fastest provider (Groq) and returns quick recommendations
3. **Given** the primary provider is unavailable, **When** the user submits any travel query, **Then** the system automatically tries the next best provider without user intervention
4. **Given** API quota limits are reached for one provider, **When** the user submits a request, **Then** the system rotates to alternative API keys or switches providers seamlessly
5. **Given** all providers fail, **When** the user submits a request, **Then** the system provides a graceful error message with suggested retry timing

### Edge Cases

- What happens when all API keys for a provider are rate-limited simultaneously?
- How does the system handle partial responses from providers during network issues?
- What occurs when a provider returns malformed or inappropriate travel content?
- How does the system behave during provider maintenance windows?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically select the optimal LLM provider based on query complexity, provider availability, and current quota status
- **FR-002**: System MUST support at least three LLM providers: Cerebras (for complex queries), Gemini (for balanced queries), and Groq (for fast queries)
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement automatic fallback chains when the primary selected provider fails or is unavailable
- **FR-004**: System MUST rotate API keys automatically when quota limits are approached or rate limiting occurs
- **FR-005**: System MUST log all provider interactions including model used, tokens consumed, latency, and fallback chain execution
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain service availability even when individual providers are down
- **FR-007**: System MUST classify travel query complexity to inform provider selection [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific complexity criteria and thresholds]
- **FR-008**: System MUST track and respect provider-specific quota limits and cost constraints [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific quota monitoring strategy and cost limits]
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide observability into provider selection decisions and fallback chain execution
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle API key rotation without service interruption [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rotation frequency and trigger conditions]
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate provider responses for travel-appropriate content before returning to users
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain response time SLAs even during provider switching [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific SLA targets]

### Key Entities

- **LLM Provider**: Represents external AI services (Cerebras, Gemini, Groq) with attributes including capabilities, quota limits, response characteristics, and availability status
- **Routing Rule**: Defines logic for selecting providers based on query complexity, current load, and provider health
- **API Key Pool**: Collection of authentication credentials for each provider with rotation status and usage tracking
- **Request Context**: Travel query with metadata including complexity score, user preferences, and routing decision audit trail
- **Fallback Chain**: Ordered sequence of alternative providers to try when primary provider fails
- **Provider Health Monitor**: Tracks availability, response times, and quota status for each LLM provider
