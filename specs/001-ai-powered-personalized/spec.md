# Feature Specification: AI-Powered Personalized Itinerary Generation

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-powered-personalized`  
**Created**: September 20, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "AI-powered personalized itinerary generation flow that takes form answers and outputs real-time customized travel itineraries using LLM integration"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description parsed: AI itinerary generation with real-time personalization
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: travelers filling forms
   ‚Üí Actions: generate personalized itineraries, real-time adjustment
   ‚Üí Data: form responses, itinerary details, preferences
   ‚Üí Constraints: real-time performance, personalization accuracy
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: LLM provider/service integration method]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Real-time update frequency and triggers]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Itinerary data sources for recommendations]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: form completion ‚Üí itinerary generation ‚Üí real-time updates
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Form responses, itinerary items, user preferences, AI recommendations
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding technical integration details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A traveler visits the Hylo platform, fills out the comprehensive trip details form (including destinations, dates, budget, preferences, travel style, etc.), clicks "Generate My Personalized Itinerary" button, and receives a customized travel itinerary that reflects their specific answers. As they modify form responses, the itinerary updates in real-time to match their new preferences.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has completed the trip details form with destination, dates, budget, and preferences, **When** they click "Generate My Personalized Itinerary", **Then** the system generates a detailed itinerary within 30 seconds that includes activities, accommodations, and dining options matching their criteria
2. **Given** a user has generated an initial itinerary, **When** they change their budget from luxury to budget-friendly, **Then** the itinerary automatically updates to show budget-appropriate recommendations within 10 seconds
3. **Given** a user modifies their travel dates, **When** the date change affects availability, **Then** the itinerary adjusts recommendations and notifies the user of any conflicts or improvements
4. **Given** a user changes their travel interests from cultural to adventure, **When** they update the form, **Then** the activity recommendations shift from museums/galleries to outdoor adventures and sports
5. **Given** a user adds dietary restrictions, **When** they save the preference, **Then** all restaurant and dining recommendations update to accommodate the new restrictions

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user selects an extremely remote destination with limited data?
- How does system handle when user changes create conflicting preferences (luxury accommodation with minimal budget)?
- What occurs when external data sources are temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system respond when user makes rapid consecutive changes to form fields?
- What happens when generated itinerary exceeds user's specified budget constraints?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST generate personalized travel itineraries based on user's form responses including destination, dates, budget, travel style, interests, and preferences
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide itinerary generation within 30 seconds of user clicking "Generate My Personalized Itinerary" button
- **FR-003**: System MUST update itinerary recommendations in real-time when users modify form fields, with updates completing within 10 seconds
- **FR-004**: System MUST include accommodation, dining, activities, and transportation recommendations in generated itineraries
- **FR-005**: System MUST respect user's budget constraints and provide options within their specified range
- **FR-006**: System MUST accommodate special preferences including dietary restrictions, accessibility needs, and travel group requirements
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide alternative recommendations when primary suggestions are unavailable or inappropriate
- **FR-008**: System MUST integrate with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific AI/LLM service not specified - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.]
- **FR-009**: System MUST access [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: travel data sources not specified - booking APIs, review platforms, local databases]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: concurrent user load not specified] simultaneous itinerary generations
- **FR-011**: System MUST store generated itineraries for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide fallback recommendations when AI service is unavailable
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate form completeness before allowing itinerary generation
- **FR-014**: System MUST display generation progress indicators to users during processing
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow users to save, modify, and share generated itineraries

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Form Response Data**: Complete user inputs including destinations, dates, budget, preferences, travel style, group composition, and special requirements
- **Generated Itinerary**: Structured travel plan containing daily schedules, accommodation suggestions, dining recommendations, activities, and transportation options
- **AI Recommendations**: Individual suggestions for activities, restaurants, accommodations, and experiences with relevance scoring and reasoning
- **User Preferences**: Stored user choices and modifications that influence itinerary personalization
- **Real-time Update Triggers**: System events that initiate itinerary regeneration based on form changes
