# Implementation Plan: Fix Vercel Deployment Errors

**Branch**: `007-fix-vercel-deployment` | **Date**: September 17, 2025 | **Spec**: [specs/007-fix-vercel-deployment/spec.md](specs/007-fix-vercel-deployment/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-fix-vercel-deployment/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Fix TypeScript compilation errors in LLM provider files (factory.ts, cerebras.ts, gemini.ts, groq.ts) and reduce serverless function count to comply with Vercel Hobby plan limits (12 functions max). Implementation will maintain constitutional compliance with edge-first architecture, multi-LLM resilience, and observable operations while ensuring successful production deployment.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x (strict mode enabled)
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18, LangChain.js, Vite, Vercel Edge Runtime
**Storage**: N/A (stateless edge functions)
**Testing**: Vitest, Playwright, Contract Testing
**Platform**: Vercel (Edge Functions)
**Target Platform**: Vercel Hobby Plan (12 function limit)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend edge functions)
**Performance Goals**: Edge Function cold start < 150ms, API route timeout 30 seconds max
**Constraints**: Vercel Hobby plan limits (12 serverless functions), TypeScript strict mode, constitutional compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page React application with multi-agent AI orchestration

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### I. Edge-First Architecture ✅ PASS

- No client-side API key exposure
- Fixes maintain edge-first approach

### II. Multi-LLM Resilience ✅ PASS

- Provider fixes maintain Cerebras/Gemini/Groq routing
- Fallback chains preserved during type fixes
- Function consolidation doesn't reduce resilience

### III. Observable AI Operations ✅ PASS

- Structured logging preserved
- Fixes don't affect observability

### IV. Type-Safe Development ✅ PASS (after fixes)

- Current state: TypeScript errors in provider files
- Required: Strict TypeScript compliance
- Fixes will resolve type safety violations

### V. Progressive Enhancement ✅ PASS

- Core functionality preserved during fixes
- No degradation of user experience
- Build fixes enable deployment

### VI. Cost-Conscious Design ✅ IMPROVED

- Function limit reduction improves cost efficiency
- Vercel Hobby plan compliance maintained
- Free tier optimization preserved

### VII. Security by Default ✅ PASS

- Environment variables remain properly scoped
- No security changes required
- Rate limiting preserved

**Overall Assessment**: PASS - Fixes resolve existing violations and improve compliance

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 - Web application (frontend + backend edge functions detected)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract test → contract test implementation task [P]
- Each provider file → type error fix task [P]
- Each functional requirement → validation task
- Build and deployment verification tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Type fixes before tests before validation
- Parallel execution for independent provider fixes [P]
- Sequential for build/deployment verification
- Dependency order: Provider fixes before function consolidation

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Key Task Categories**:

1. **Type Error Fixes** (Parallel): Fix ProviderStatus assignments and missing properties
2. **Contract Tests** (Parallel): Implement API contract validation tests
3. **Build Validation** (Sequential): Verify TypeScript compilation and function limits
4. **Deployment Testing** (Sequential): Test Vercel deployment process

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
