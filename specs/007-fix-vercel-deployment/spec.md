# Feature Specification: Fix Vercel Deployment Errors

**Feature Branch**: `007-fix-vercel-deployment`
**Created**: September 17, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Fix Vercel deployment errors: TypeScript compilation errors in provider files and Hobby plan function limit exceeded"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí TypeScript compilation errors in provider files identified
   ‚Üí Vercel Hobby plan function limit issue identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Vercel deployment system, TypeScript compiler
   ‚Üí Actions: Fix type errors, reduce function count
   ‚Üí Data: Provider configurations, function definitions
   ‚Üí Constraints: Hobby plan limits, TypeScript strict mode
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No ambiguities found - errors are clearly specified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear deployment success criteria defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement directly addresses specific errors
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Provider configurations and function definitions
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No uncertainties - all requirements are concrete
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT needs to be fixed and WHY deployment fails
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific code changes, just requirements)
- üë• Written for deployment and development teams

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements
- **Optional sections**: Key Entities (relevant for provider configurations)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer deploying the Hylo Travel AI application, I want the Vercel deployment to succeed without TypeScript compilation errors or function limit violations, so that the application can be deployed to production reliably.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the codebase has TypeScript compilation errors in provider files, **When** I run `npm run build`, **Then** the build completes successfully without TypeScript errors
2. **Given** the Vercel deployment has more than 12 serverless functions, **When** I deploy to Vercel Hobby plan, **Then** the deployment succeeds without function limit errors
3. **Given** provider status types are incorrectly defined, **When** the TypeScript compiler runs, **Then** all type assignments are valid and no type errors occur

### Edge Cases

- What happens when new provider types are added in the future?
- How does the system handle Vercel plan upgrades or downgrades?
- What if additional API endpoints are needed beyond the current limit?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST resolve all TypeScript compilation errors in provider files (factory.ts, cerebras.ts, gemini.ts, groq.ts)
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure ProviderStatus type assignments are valid and type-safe
- **FR-003**: System MUST fix 'apiKeyName' property errors in CerebrasConfig and GeminiConfig types
- **FR-004**: System MUST reduce the number of serverless functions to comply with Vercel Hobby plan limits (12 functions maximum)
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality while fixing deployment issues
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure build process completes successfully on Vercel infrastructure
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve constitutional compliance requirements during fixes

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Provider Configuration**: Represents LLM provider settings with valid type definitions and status tracking
- **Serverless Function**: Represents Vercel deployment functions with proper routing and limits
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Represents build process validation with strict type checking
