# Tasks: Production Hardening & Frontend Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-production-hardening/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: TypeScript 5.x, React 18, LangChain.js, Vite, Vercel Edge Runtime
   → Structure: Web application (frontend + edge backend)
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 6 entities (ErrorBoundaryContext, HealthMetrics, etc.)
   → contracts/: 5 API endpoints for health, monitoring, security
   → research.md: 6 technical decisions for error boundaries, testing, monitoring
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Enhanced project structure, dependencies, testing infrastructure
   → Tests: Contract tests, integration tests, error boundary tests
   → Core: Error boundaries, monitoring services, security middleware
   → Integration: Health checks, observability, performance monitoring
   → Polish: UI/UX enhancements, comprehensive validation
4. Task rules applied:
   → Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD approach)
5. Tasks numbered sequentially (T001-T030)
6. Dependencies validated and ordering enforced
```

## Dependencies

**Critical Path**:

- Setup (T001-T005) before all tests
- All tests (T006-T020) before any implementation (T021+)
- Data models (T021-T024) before services (T025-T031)
- Core error handling (T025-T028) before integration (T037-T048)
- API endpoints (T032-T036) before monitoring integration (T045-T048)

**Parallel Execution Blocks**:

- T002, T003, T004, T005 (different directories)
- T006-T011 (contract tests - different files)
- T012-T016 (integration tests - different files)
- T017-T020 (component tests - different files)
- T021-T024 (type definitions - different files)
- T025, T026, T027 (error handling - different files)
- T029, T030, T031 (monitoring hooks - different files)

## Parallel Execution Example

```bash
# Launch contract tests together:
Task: "Contract test GET /api/health/system in tests/contract/health-system.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/health/providers in tests/contract/health-providers.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/monitoring/errors in tests/contract/monitoring-errors.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/monitoring/metrics in tests/contract/monitoring-metrics.test.ts"

# Launch data model creation together:
Task: "ErrorBoundaryContext interface in src/types/error.ts"
Task: "HealthMetrics interface in src/types/monitoring.ts"
Task: "SecurityEvent interface in src/types/security.ts"
Task: "PerformanceMetrics interface in src/types/performance.ts"
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks target different files with no dependencies
- All tests must fail before implementation begins
- Commit after each completed task
- Constitutional compliance verified throughout
- Performance goals: <2.5s LCP, <150ms edge cold start, <200KB bundle

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T006-T011)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T021-T024)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T006-T020 before T021+)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent ([P] markers verified)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD approach enforced (tests must fail before implementation)
- [x] Dependencies properly ordered and documented
