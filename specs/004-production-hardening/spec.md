# Feature Specification: Production Hardening & Frontend Enhancement

## Overview

This feature focuses on hardening the Hylo travel planning application for production deployment with comprehensive testing, monitoring, error handling, and frontend UI/UX improvements to ensure a production-grade user experience.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**As a travel planner**, I want the application to be reliable and always available so that I can plan trips without worrying about system failures.

**As a travel planner**, I want a polished, intuitive interface that feels professional and trustworthy so that I can focus on planning rather than figuring out how to use the system.

**As a system administrator**, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting so that I can proactively address issues before they impact users.

**As a developer**, I want robust error handling and testing so that I can deploy changes confidently without breaking the user experience.
