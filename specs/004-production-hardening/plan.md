# Implementation Plan: Production Hardening & Frontend Enhancement

**Branch**: `004-production-hardening` | **Date**: September 17, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-production-hardening/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - enhancing existing frontend + edge backend structure

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

api/
└── [same as backend above]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]

```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research ✅ COMPLETED

**Research Tasks Completed**:

1. **Error Boundary Best Practices** - Research React Error Boundary patterns for LLM applications ✅
2. **Production Testing Strategies** - Research comprehensive testing approaches for edge functions and React apps ✅
3. **Advanced Monitoring Patterns** - Research observability patterns for Vercel Edge Functions with LangSmith ✅
4. **UI/UX Design Systems** - Research production-grade design patterns and accessibility standards ✅
5. **Security Hardening Techniques** - Research security best practices for edge functions and React apps ✅
6. **Performance Optimization** - Research bundle optimization and edge function performance tuning ✅

**Research agents dispatched and findings consolidated** → research.md ✅

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented and no NEEDS CLARIFICATION remaining

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts ✅ COMPLETED

_Prerequisites: research.md complete ✅_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`: ✅

   - Entity definitions for error handling, monitoring, testing, UI enhancement, security, and performance
   - Validation rules and state transitions documented
   - Relationships between entities mapped

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements: ✅

   - Health monitoring endpoints (`/api/health/system`, `/api/health/providers`)
   - Error reporting endpoint (`/api/monitoring/errors`)
   - Metrics collection endpoints (`/api/monitoring/metrics`)
   - Security event logging (`/api/security/events`)
   - Input validation endpoint (`/api/validation/input`)
   - OpenAPI 3.0 schema output to `/contracts/api.yaml`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts: ✅

   - Comprehensive test suite in `/contracts/api.test.ts`
   - Request/response schema validation
   - Error handling validation
   - Integration test scenarios

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories: ✅

   - Happy path user journey testing
   - Error handling and recovery scenarios
   - Mobile responsiveness validation
   - Security and performance validation
   - Quickstart guide with validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally**: ✅
   - Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with production hardening context
   - Added recent changes documentation
   - Preserved manual additions and constitutional requirements
   - Updated implementation status

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
