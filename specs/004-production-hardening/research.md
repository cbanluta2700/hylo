# Phase 0: Research & Technical Decisions

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Error Boundary Best Practices

**Decision**: Implement React Error Boundaries with contextual fallback components  
**Rationale**:

- React 18 Error Boundaries provide granular error isolation
- Contextual fallbacks maintain user workflow continuity
- Automatic error reporting improves debugging capabilities
- Graceful degradation aligns with Progressive Enhancement principle

**Alternatives considered**:

- Global try-catch wrappers (rejected: less granular control)
- Error handling in individual components (rejected: scattered, inconsistent)
- Third-party error boundary libraries (rejected: adds unnecessary dependencies)

**Implementation approach**:

- `ErrorBoundary` component with contextual error messages
- `AIServiceErrorBoundary` specifically for LLM failures
- `RouteErrorBoundary` for navigation-level errors
- Integration with LangSmith for error tracing

### 2. Production Testing Strategies

**Decision**: Multi-layered testing with TDD approach and contract-first development  
**Rationale**:

- Contract tests ensure API compatibility across LLM provider changes
- Integration tests validate multi-agent workflow reliability
- E2E tests verify complete user journeys work as expected
- Performance tests ensure edge function SLA compliance

**Alternatives considered**:

- Unit tests only (rejected: insufficient for complex LLM workflows)
- Manual testing approach (rejected: not scalable for production)
- Snapshot testing for UI (rejected: brittle for dynamic content)

**Implementation approach**:

- Vitest for unit tests with high coverage targets (90%+)
- Testing Library for React component testing
- Playwright for E2E testing with real browser automation
- Custom contract testing for LLM routing endpoints
- Performance testing for edge function cold starts

### 3. Advanced Monitoring Patterns

**Decision**: Multi-dimensional observability with LangSmith + custom dashboards  
**Rationale**:

- LangSmith provides AI-specific tracing and debugging
- Custom health dashboards enable proactive issue detection
- Cost monitoring prevents quota overruns
- Performance metrics ensure SLA compliance

**Alternatives considered**:

- Basic logging only (rejected: insufficient for production debugging)
- Third-party APM tools (rejected: cost and complexity for edge functions)
- Custom monitoring from scratch (rejected: reinventing the wheel)

**Implementation approach**:

- Enhanced LangSmith integration with structured metadata
- Real-time health endpoints for all providers
- Cost tracking dashboard with quota alerts
- Performance monitoring with P95/P99 latency tracking
- Error rate monitoring with automatic escalation

### 4. UI/UX Design System Enhancement

**Decision**: Design system enhancement with accessibility-first approach  
**Rationale**:

- Consistent design system improves user trust and usability
- Accessibility compliance is required for production applications
- Mobile-first responsive design ensures broad device compatibility
- Loading states and micro-interactions improve perceived performance

**Alternatives considered**:

- Complete UI redesign (rejected: unnecessary, breaks user familiarity)
- Third-party component library (rejected: conflicts with existing Tailwind setup)
- Minimal styling changes (rejected: doesn't meet production-grade requirements)

**Implementation approach**:

- Enhanced Tailwind design tokens for consistency
- Accessibility audit and ARIA label implementation
- Responsive grid system optimization
- Loading state patterns and skeleton loaders
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Form validation and error state improvements

### 5. Security Hardening Techniques

**Decision**: Defense-in-depth security with input validation and rate limiting  
**Rationale**:

- Multiple security layers provide resilience against various attack vectors
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Rate limiting prevents abuse and resource exhaustion
- Security headers provide additional browser-level protection

**Alternatives considered**:

- Basic validation only (rejected: insufficient for production exposure)
- WAF-only approach (rejected: doesn't address application-level vulnerabilities)
- Authentication-first (rejected: conflicts with current public access model)

**Implementation approach**:

- Zod schema validation for all inputs
- Rate limiting middleware for edge functions
- CORS policy hardening
- Security headers implementation
- Input sanitization for all user content
- API key rotation monitoring

### 6. Performance Optimization Strategies

**Decision**: Bundle optimization with intelligent caching and code splitting  
**Rationale**:

- Bundle size directly impacts loading performance
- Code splitting enables progressive loading
- Intelligent caching reduces repeat request overhead
- Edge function optimization improves cold start times

**Alternatives considered**:

- No optimization (rejected: doesn't meet performance targets)
- Server-side rendering (rejected: conflicts with edge-first architecture)
- Static site generation (rejected: incompatible with dynamic AI content)

**Implementation approach**:

- Vite bundle analysis and optimization
- Dynamic imports for non-critical components
- Service worker caching strategy
- Edge function optimization for cold starts
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- CSS optimization and tree shaking

## Architecture Decisions

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Granular Error Boundaries**: Different boundaries for AI services, routing, and UI components
- **Contextual Fallbacks**: Error messages provide actionable next steps
- **Automatic Recovery**: Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- **Error Reporting**: Integration with monitoring for proactive issue resolution

### Testing Strategy

- **Contract-First**: API contracts define expected behavior
- **TDD Approach**: Tests written before implementation
- **Pyramid Structure**: Many unit tests, fewer integration tests, focused E2E tests
- **Performance Gates**: Automated performance validation in CI/CD

### Monitoring Strategy

- **Multi-Layer Observability**: Application, infrastructure, and business metrics
- **Proactive Alerting**: Threshold-based alerts with escalation paths
- **Cost Awareness**: Real-time quota monitoring with automatic throttling
- **User Experience**: Performance monitoring from user perspective

### Security Strategy

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security controls at different layers
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse while maintaining user experience
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and alerting
