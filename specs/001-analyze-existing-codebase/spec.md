2. **Preference Selection**: Multiple choice selections for travel style and preferences
3. **AI Itinerary Generation**: Multi-agent AI system using Groq API for intelligent travel planning
4. **Real-time Feedback**: Behind-the-scenes view of AI agents processing
5. **Personalized Output**: Generated itinerary based on all user inputs

### Form Categories

1. **Trip Details**: Location, dates, travelers, budget
2. **Travel Group**: Solo, couple, family, friends, etc.
3. **Travel Interests**: Nature, culture, food, adventure, etc.
4. **Itinerary Inclusions**: Accommodations, dining, transportation, activities, guides
5. **Travel Experience**: Experience levels and comfort zones
6. **Trip Vibe**: Relaxation, adventure, cultural immersion, etc.
7. **Sample Days**: Example day preferences
8. **Dining Preferences**: Meal choices and dietary considerations
9. **Trip Nickname & Contact**: Personal identifiers and contact info

### AI Processing

1. **Multi-Agent System**: Data gatherer, analyzer, planner agents working in sequence
2. **Real-time Logging**: Agent activities visible to users during generation
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and error messaging
4. **Selection Validation**: Ensure user choices are properly processed

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Itinerary generation should complete within 30-60 seconds
- Real-time updates during AI processing
- Responsive UI that works on mobile and desktop
- Smooth scrolling to results after generation

### Reliability

- Multi-LLM fallback system (per constitution)
- Error handling for API failures
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Security

- API keys must not be exposed in client-side code
- All AI operations routed through secure edge functions
- Input sanitization for user-provided content

### Usability

- Intuitive step-by-step form progression
- Clear visual feedback during processing
- Beautiful, accessible UI with proper styling
- Form validation and error messaging

## Technical Constraints

### Architecture Requirements (Per Constitution)

1. **Edge-First**: All LLM interactions through Vercel Edge Functions
2. **Multi-LLM Resilience**: Cerebras, Google Gemini, Groq with fallbacks
3. **Observable Operations**: LangSmith tracing for all AI interactions
4. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript throughout
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works with degraded services
6. **Cost-Conscious**: Respect free tier limits with intelligent routing

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18.3+ with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **AI Integration**: Groq SDK
- **Deployment**: Vercel (implied by constitution)

### Current Implementation Status

- ✅ React + TypeScript frontend
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling
- ✅ Multi-agent AI system with Groq
- ✅ Real-time agent logging
- ❓ Edge function implementation (needs verification)
- ❓ Multi-LLM fallback system (needs verification)
- ❓ LangSmith tracing (needs verification)
- ❓ Proper security implementation (needs verification)

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success

1. All form categories collect user preferences properly
2. AI agents process selections accurately and generate relevant itineraries
3. Real-time feedback provides meaningful insights into AI processing
4. Generated itineraries reflect user selections and preferences
5. Error handling provides clear guidance to users

### Technical Success

1. Code follows constitutional principles (edge-first, type-safe, observable)
2. Multi-LLM resilience implemented with proper fallbacks
3. Security requirements met (no exposed keys, proper authentication)
4. Performance targets achieved (< 2s streaming start, < 30s completion)
5. Cost management through intelligent routing and caching

### Quality Success

1. 80%+ code coverage for non-UI logic
2. TypeScript strict mode with no `any` types
3. Proper error boundaries and loading states
4. Responsive design that works on all devices
5. Accessible UI following WCAG guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria

### Analysis Completeness

1. **Architecture Assessment**: Document current vs. constitutional requirements
2. **Feature Inventory**: Catalog all implemented functionality
3. **Code Quality Review**: Assess TypeScript usage, error handling, testing
4. **Security Audit**: Verify API key management and security practices
5. **Performance Analysis**: Measure current performance against targets
6. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing constitutional requirements

### Documentation Deliverables

1. **Technical Architecture**: Current system design and data flow
2. **API Documentation**: All service interfaces and data models
3. **Component Inventory**: React component structure and relationships
4. **Integration Points**: AI service integrations and fallback logic
5. **Deployment Guide**: Current deployment process and requirements
6. **Migration Plan**: Steps to achieve full constitutional compliance

## Dependencies

### External Services

- Groq API for AI model access
- Potential Vercel deployment platform
- Environment variable management system

### Internal Dependencies

- Existing React component library
- TypeScript type definitions
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Vite build configuration

## Risks and Assumptions

### Risks

1. Current implementation may not follow edge-first architecture
2. Single LLM dependency creates reliability risks
3. Exposed API keys could create security vulnerabilities
4. Missing observability could make debugging difficult
5. Cost management may not be implemented

### Assumptions

1. Existing code represents functional travel itinerary generation
2. User interface provides good user experience
3. AI integration produces quality itineraries
4. Current architecture can be evolved to meet constitutional requirements

## Out of Scope

- New feature development beyond existing functionality
- Complete rewrite or major architectural changes
- Integration with additional travel services or booking APIs
- User authentication or account management systems
- Payment processing or commercial features

This analysis focuses on understanding and documenting the existing system to enable informed decisions about future development and constitutional compliance.
