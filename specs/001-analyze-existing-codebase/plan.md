## Summary

Analysis of existing Hylo travel itinerary generator - a React/TypeScript application using Groq AI for multi-agent travel planning. Current implementation needs constitutional compliance review and potential migration to edge-first architecture with multi-LLM resilience.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.5+ (existing), React 18.3+
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18, Groq SDK, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React
**Storage**: None (stateless form-based application)
**Testing**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (no visible test setup)
**Platform**: Current: Direct browser, Target: Vercel Edge Functions
**Target Platform**: Web browser (responsive design)
**Project Type**: Single project (existing src/ structure)
**Performance Goals**: <2s streaming start, <30s completion, <2.5s LCP
**Constraints**: <200KB bundle, 30s max timeout, free tier API limits
**Scale/Scope**: Individual travel planning sessions, no user accounts

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### ❌ Edge-First Architecture

**Current**: Direct Groq API calls from frontend with exposed API key
**Required**: All LLM interactions through Vercel Edge Functions
**Risk**: Security vulnerability, API key exposure

### ❌ Multi-LLM Resilience

**Current**: Single Groq provider only
**Required**: Cerebras, Google Gemini, Groq with intelligent routing and fallbacks
**Risk**: Service availability, rate limiting failures

### ❌ Observable AI Operations

**Current**: Basic agent logging in UI only
**Required**: LangSmith tracing for all LLM interactions with structured logging
**Risk**: Debugging difficulties, no cost tracking

### ✅ Type-Safe Development

**Current**: TypeScript throughout, proper interfaces
**Status**: Compliant with strict typing

### ❌ Progressive Enhancement

**Current**: No fallback handling for LLM failures
**Required**: Graceful degradation, error boundaries
**Risk**: Poor UX during service outages

### ❌ Cost-Conscious Design

**Current**: No usage tracking, caching, or throttling
**Required**: Free tier management, request batching, intelligent routing
**Risk**: Unexpected costs, rate limit violations

### ❌ Security by Default

**Current**: API key in environment variables (client-side)
**Required**: Edge function routing, proper CORS, input sanitization
**Risk**: API key exposure, security vulnerabilities

**Structure Decision**: Single project with constitutional enhancements needed

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Research Tasks Identified**:

1. **Vercel Edge Functions migration pattern** for existing Groq integration
2. **Multi-LLM provider integration** (Cerebras, Gemini, Groq) with unified interface
3. **LangSmith tracing setup** for TypeScript/Node.js applications
4. **Cost management strategies** for multiple AI providers with free tiers
5. **Error handling patterns** for LLM failures and progressive enhancement
6. **Security best practices** for API key management in Vercel environment
7. **Testing strategies** for AI-powered applications with mocked responses
8. **Performance optimization** for streaming LLM responses through edge functions

**Phase 0 Execution**: Generate research.md with findings and decisions for each unknown

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete ✅_

**Design Tasks**:

1. **Extract entities** from existing codebase:

   - TravelFormData interface and validation schemas
   - AgentLog structure and tracing requirements
   - API request/response models for edge functions

2. **Generate API contracts** for constitutional compliance:

   - Edge function endpoints (/api/itinerary, /api/health)
   - Multi-agent orchestration interfaces
   - Provider routing and fallback logic

3. **Generate contract tests** for edge functions:

   - Request validation tests
   - Response schema verification
   - Error handling scenarios

4. **Update agent context** for GitHub Copilot:
   - Add constitutional requirements
   - Include current project structure
   - Specify edge-first patterns

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

1. **Constitutional Compliance Tasks** (Priority 1):

   - Create Vercel Edge Functions structure
   - Implement multi-LLM provider routing
   - Add LangSmith tracing integration
   - Implement proper error boundaries

2. **Migration Tasks** (Priority 2):

   - Move Groq logic to edge functions
   - Update frontend to use edge endpoints
   - Add security and rate limiting
   - Implement cost tracking

3. **Testing Infrastructure** (Priority 3):
   - Setup testing framework
   - Create contract tests for APIs
   - Add integration tests for multi-agent flows
   - E2E tests for critical user journeys

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Infrastructure first (edge functions, providers)
- Core migration (move existing logic)
- Enhancement (tracing, cost management)
- Testing and validation

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation                 | Why Needed                                                                              | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-LLM Provider System | Resilience against single provider failures, cost optimization across free tiers        | Single provider creates reliability risk and cost exposure          |
| Edge Function Migration   | Security (API key protection), performance (edge computing), constitutional requirement | Client-side API calls expose keys and violate constitution          |
| LangSmith Tracing         | Debugging complex multi-agent flows, cost tracking, performance optimization            | Basic logging insufficient for AI operation observability           |
| Comprehensive Testing     | AI applications require contract testing, mocking complex LLM responses                 | Simple unit tests inadequate for multi-provider, multi-agent system |
