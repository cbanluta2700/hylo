## Summary
Primary requirement: Implement a multi-agent AI workflow system that coordinates four specialized agents (Content Planner, Website Info Gatherer, Planning Strategist, Content Compiler) to generate enhanced, personalized travel itineraries with real-time information gathering and strategic planning.

Technical approach: Integrate LangChain orchestration with LangGraph StateGraph for agent coordination, utilize vector embeddings via Jina and Upstash Vector for information retrieval, implement real-time web search capabilities, and deliver structured itinerary output with specific formatting requirements.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.5.3, React 18.3.1, Node.js 20+  
**Primary Dependencies**: LangChain, LangGraph, Jina AI embeddings, Upstash Vector, Qdrant, Groq SDK, Cerebras SDK, Google Gemini, LangSmith, Upstash QStash  
**Storage**: Upstash Vector for embeddings, Qdrant for vector search, session state management  
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library for frontend, contract tests for API endpoints  
**Target Platform**: Vercel Edge Runtime, React SPA frontend  
**Project Type**: web - determines source structure for frontend + backend  
**Performance Goals**: <2s API response time, <500ms to first token streaming, multi-agent workflow <30s total  
**Constraints**: Edge function 30s timeout, <200KB bundle size, <10MB memory per function, $10/day AI cost budget  
**Scale/Scope**: Support concurrent itinerary generation, 4 AI agents per workflow, real-time web search integration

**User-specified workflow details**:
1. **Content Planner**: Analyzes form data and identifies what real-time web information is needed
2. **Data Flow**: LangChain → LangChain Text Splitter → Jina Embeddings → Vector Database (Qdrant/Upstash Vector) → LangGraph StateGraph coordination
3. **Website Info Gatherer**: Uses Groq models (compound) to gather real-time information from web sources
4. **Planning Strategist**: Processes gathered information to determine strategic recommendations and usage
5. **Content Compiler**: Assembles final itinerary with specific output format structure

**Required Output Format**:
- **TRIP SUMMARY**: Trip nickname, dates (departure/return or planned days), travelers (adults/children count), budget (amount, currency, mode: per-person/total/flexible)
- **Prepared for**: Contact name from form
- **DAILY ITINERARY**: Day-by-day activities section with duration based on trip dates
- **TIPS FOR YOUR TRIP**: Travel tips and recommendations section

**Technical Stack Integration**: LangChain RunnableParallel, Upstash Vector, Groq inference, Cerebras.ai inference, Google Gemini, LangGraph StateGraph, LangSmith tracing, Upstash QStash/Workflow, Vercel Edge Functions.

## Constitution Check

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - React frontend with Vercel Edge Functions backend

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - LangGraph StateGraph implementation patterns for multi-agent coordination
   - Jina AI embeddings integration with Upstash Vector
   - Real-time web search service selection and integration
   - Agent communication protocols and error handling strategies
   - Performance optimization for 30s Edge function timeout constraint

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research LangGraph StateGraph patterns for 4-agent workflow coordination"
   Task: "Find best practices for Jina embeddings with Upstash Vector integration"
   Task: "Research real-time web search APIs compatible with Edge Runtime"
   Task: "Find multi-agent error handling and fallback strategies"
   Task: "Research streaming response patterns for long-running agent workflows"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`:
   - Decision: LangGraph StateGraph with conditional routing
   - Rationale: Native support for agent coordination, error handling, and state management
   - Alternatives considered: Custom orchestration, LangChain LCEL chains

**Output**: ✅ research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - AgentWorkflowSession, ContentPlanningContext, GatheredInformation
   - StrategicPlanningFramework, CompiledItineraryOutput
   - Validation rules and state transitions documented

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - POST /api/llm/workflow/generate - Main workflow endpoint
   - GET /api/llm/workflow/status/{sessionId} - Progress tracking
   - WebSocket /api/llm/workflow/stream/{sessionId} - Real-time updates
   - OpenAPI schema in `/contracts/workflow-api.json`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - workflow-api.test.ts - Endpoint schema validation
   - agent-communication.test.ts - Inter-agent data flow
   - Tests fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - E2E workflow test: Form submission → Multi-agent processing → Structured output
   - Error handling test: Agent failure → Graceful degradation
   - Performance test: Workflow completion within 30s timeout

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Updated .github/copilot-instructions.md with new multi-agent context
   - Added workflow patterns, agent roles, and technical stack
   - Preserved existing trip details enhancement context

**Output**: ✅ data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate from Phase 1 design (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each API contract → contract test task [P]
- Each agent → implementation task with interface
- Each workflow state → state management task
- Integration tasks for LangChain, vector DB, embeddings
- Frontend components for enhanced itinerary display

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Agent interfaces → Implementation
- Dependency order: Core types → Agent services → Orchestration → Frontend
- Parallel execution: Agent implementations [P], contract tests [P]

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks covering:
- Phase 1: Agent interface definitions and contract tests (10 tasks)
- Phase 2: Core agent implementations (12 tasks)
- Phase 3: Workflow orchestration and state management (8 tasks)
- Phase 4: Frontend integration and streaming UI (6 tasks)
- Phase 5: Testing and performance optimization (4 tasks)

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation following TDD principles and constitutional requirements  
**Phase 5**: Validation including performance testing, cost monitoring, and user acceptance

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - section not needed*
