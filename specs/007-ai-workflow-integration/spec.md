# Feature Specification: AI Multi-Agent Workflow for Itinerary Generation

**Feature Branch**: `007-ai-workflow-integration`  
**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "AI workflow integration with multi-agent system for itinerary generation using Content Planner, Website Info Gatherer, Planning Strategist, Content Compiler roles with langchain, qdrant, jina embeddings, upstash vector, groq, cerebras, gemini, langgraph, langsmith, qstash workflow"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: Multi-agent AI system for enhanced itinerary generation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Four AI agent roles (Content Planner, Website Info Gatherer, Planning Strategist, Content Compiler)
   ‚Üí Actions: Collaborative itinerary generation, real-time data gathering, strategic planning
   ‚Üí Data: Travel preferences, destination information, itinerary components
   ‚Üí Constraints: Integration with existing form system, performance requirements
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Agent coordination patterns and error handling between agents]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Data retention policies for gathered web information]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance targets for multi-agent workflow execution time]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User submits travel form ‚Üí Multi-agent processing ‚Üí Enhanced itinerary
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on user-facing capabilities and system behaviors
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Agent Workflow, Itinerary Generation Session, Content Sources, Planning Context
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding agent coordination and performance targets"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A traveler fills out their trip details form and expects to receive a comprehensive, personalized itinerary that incorporates real-time destination information, strategic travel planning, and well-organized content. The system should provide richer, more accurate recommendations by leveraging multiple AI agents that specialize in different aspects of travel planning.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has completed the trip details form, **When** they click "Generate Itinerary", **Then** the system initiates a multi-agent workflow that produces an enhanced itinerary within acceptable time limits
2. **Given** the multi-agent system is processing, **When** real-time destination data is gathered, **Then** the itinerary reflects current information about attractions, events, and local conditions
3. **Given** multiple AI agents are working collaboratively, **When** one agent encounters an error, **Then** the system gracefully handles the failure and continues with available agent capabilities
4. **Given** an itinerary generation session is complete, **When** the user views their results, **Then** they receive a well-structured, personalized travel plan that demonstrates clear improvement over single-agent generation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external data sources are unavailable during web information gathering?
- How does the system handle conflicting recommendations between different AI agents?
- What occurs when the multi-agent workflow exceeds expected processing time limits?
- How does the system manage partial failures where some agents succeed and others fail?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST coordinate four specialized AI agents (Content Planner, Website Info Gatherer, Planning Strategist, Content Compiler) to generate enhanced itineraries
- **FR-002**: System MUST gather real-time destination information to supplement static travel data
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide strategic travel planning that considers user preferences, budget, and logistical constraints
- **FR-004**: System MUST compile and organize content from multiple agents into a coherent, well-structured itinerary
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain session state throughout the multi-agent workflow process
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle agent failures gracefully without completely breaking the itinerary generation process
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide progress feedback to users during multi-agent processing
- **FR-008**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with the existing trip details form submission workflow
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain data consistency across all agent interactions
- **FR-010**: System MUST complete multi-agent workflows within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum acceptable processing time not specified]
- **FR-011**: System MUST store and manage workflow execution traces for monitoring and debugging
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle concurrent itinerary generation requests without resource conflicts
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate and sanitize all externally gathered information before inclusion in itineraries
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide fallback mechanisms when advanced multi-agent features are unavailable
- **FR-015**: System MUST respect rate limits and usage quotas for all integrated AI services and data sources

### Key Entities
- **Agent Workflow Session**: Represents a single multi-agent collaboration instance, tracking state, progress, and results across all four agent roles
- **Content Planning Context**: Contains strategic decisions about itinerary structure, themes, and content organization made by the Content Planner agent
- **Gathered Information Repository**: Stores real-time data collected by the Website Info Gatherer, including source attribution and freshness timestamps
- **Strategic Planning Framework**: Encompasses the logical travel flow, timing decisions, and optimization recommendations from the Planning Strategist
- **Compiled Itinerary Output**: The final structured travel plan that integrates contributions from all agents into a user-ready format
- **Agent Communication Protocol**: Defines how agents share information, coordinate decisions, and handle inter-agent dependencies
- **Workflow Execution Trace**: Detailed logging of agent activities, decisions, and performance metrics for monitoring and improvement
