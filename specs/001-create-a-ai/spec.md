# Feature Specification: AI-Powered Itinerary Generation Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-ai`  
**Created**: September 23, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create a AI workflow that will generate and display an itinerary based on the forms answered by the user in this existing codebase. This will be deployed and used in vercel +vite"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature clearly defined: AI workflow for itinerary generation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identified: AI integration, form data processing, itinerary generation, display system
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User flow established: form completion → AI processing → itinerary display
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → All requirements testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (itinerary data structures)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Focus on user value and business requirements only
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A traveler completes the multi-step travel planning form (location, dates, budget, travel style preferences, interests, etc.) and receives a personalized, detailed day-by-day itinerary generated by AI that matches their preferences and requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has completed all required form fields (location, dates, travelers, budget), **When** they click "Generate Itinerary", **Then** the system displays a detailed multi-day itinerary with daily activities, restaurants, accommodations, and budget breakdowns

2. **Given** a user has provided travel style preferences (adventure, relaxation, culture, etc.) and interests, **When** the AI generates the itinerary, **Then** the recommendations match their specified preferences and interests

3. **Given** a user has set a specific budget and currency, **When** the itinerary is generated, **Then** all recommendations stay within the budget constraints and costs are displayed in the correct currency

4. **Given** a user has flexible dates enabled, **When** the AI generates the itinerary, **Then** the system provides alternative date suggestions that may offer better pricing or availability

5. **Given** the AI service is temporarily unavailable, **When** a user tries to generate an itinerary, **Then** the system displays a helpful error message and allows retry functionality

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user provides conflicting preferences (luxury budget with budget accommodations)?
- How does the system handle destinations with limited tourist infrastructure or data?
- What occurs when the travel dates fall during local holidays or events that affect availability?
- How does the system respond when the specified budget is unrealistic for the destination and travel style?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST collect comprehensive travel preferences from existing form components (TripDetails, TravelStyle, interests, budget, etc.)
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate with AI service to generate personalized itineraries based on form data
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that all required form fields are completed before allowing itinerary generation
- **FR-004**: System MUST display generated itinerary in a structured, readable format with daily breakdowns
- **FR-005**: System MUST show activity progress and loading states during AI generation process
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle AI service errors gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- **FR-007**: System MUST respect user budget constraints in all itinerary recommendations
- **FR-008**: System MUST display costs in the user's selected currency throughout the itinerary
- **FR-009**: System MUST include accommodation, dining, activity, and transportation recommendations for each day
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to regenerate itinerary if unsatisfied with results
- **FR-011**: System MUST work seamlessly with existing form validation and state management
- **FR-012**: System MUST be optimized for deployment on Vercel with Vite build system
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide estimated time and cost breakdown for each recommended activity
- **FR-014**: System MUST include practical travel tips and local insights in the itinerary
- **FR-015**: System MUST support different travel group sizes (solo, couple, family, group) with appropriate recommendations

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What AI service will be used - OpenAI, Claude, or existing Groq service integration?]
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should itineraries be saved/persistent for users to access later?]
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is offline/cached itinerary viewing required?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **TravelFormData**: Complete user input from all form sections including location, dates, budget, preferences, travel style answers, group composition, and interests
- **GeneratedItinerary**: AI-generated travel plan containing daily schedules, activities, accommodations, dining recommendations, transportation, costs, and practical tips
- **DayPlan**: Individual day structure within itinerary including morning/afternoon/evening activities, meals, accommodation, transportation, budget breakdown, and local tips
- **Activity**: Specific recommended activity with details like name, description, duration, cost, location, booking requirements, and user tips
- **Accommodation**: Recommended lodging with name, type, location, price range, amenities, and booking information
- **DiningRecommendation**: Restaurant suggestions with cuisine type, price range, location, specialties, dietary accommodations, and reservation requirements
