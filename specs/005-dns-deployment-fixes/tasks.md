# Tasks: DNS & Deployment Fixes

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-dns-deployment-fixes/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: TypeScript 5.x, React 18, LangChain.js, Vite, Vercel Edge Runtime
   → Project type: web (frontend + API edge functions)
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: DNS verification models, enhanced provider status models
   → contracts/: DNS verification endpoints, provider status endpoints
   → research.md: DNS propagation best practices, TypeScript strict mode compliance
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: TypeScript configuration, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests for DNS and provider status
   → Core: DNS verification service, enhanced provider status models
   → Integration: Vercel deployment pipeline, Edge Function health checks
   → Polish: monitoring, documentation, performance validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Target files:
   → api/dns/ (new directory)
   → api/providers/ (existing, needs enhancement)
   → api/types/ (existing, needs interface updates)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 3.1: Setup

- [ ] T001 Create DNS verification API structure in `api/dns/` directory
- [ ] T002 [P] Install DNS lookup dependencies (node:dns, node:util)
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure TypeScript strict mode compliance for provider status types

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3

**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

- [ ] T004 [P] Contract test POST /api/dns/verify in `specs/005-dns-deployment-fixes/contracts/dns-verification.test.ts`
- [ ] T005 [P] Contract test GET /api/dns/verify/{id} in `specs/005-dns-deployment-fixes/contracts/dns-verification.test.ts`
- [ ] T006 [P] Contract test GET /api/providers/status in `specs/005-dns-deployment-fixes/contracts/provider-status.test.ts`
- [ ] T007 [P] Contract test GET /api/providers/{provider}/status in `specs/005-dns-deployment-fixes/contracts/provider-status.test.ts`
- [ ] T008 [P] Integration test DNS propagation verification in `tests/integration/test_dns_propagation.ts`
- [ ] T009 [P] Integration test provider status monitoring in `tests/integration/test_provider_monitoring.ts`

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

### TypeScript Type Safety Fixes

- [ ] T010 [P] Fix ProviderStatus type conflicts in `api/types/requests.ts`
- [ ] T011 [P] Update DetailedProviderStatus interface in `api/types/provider.ts`
- [ ] T012 [P] Fix index signature access in `api/providers/cerebras.ts`
- [ ] T013 [P] Fix index signature access in `api/providers/gemini.ts`
- [ ] T014 [P] Fix index signature access in `api/providers/groq.ts`

### DNS Verification Implementation

- [ ] T015 [P] DNSVerificationRequest model in `api/types/dns.ts`
- [ ] T016 [P] DNSVerificationResponse model in `api/types/dns.ts`
- [ ] T017 [P] DNSPropagationEvent model in `api/types/dns.ts`
- [ ] T018 DNS verification service in `api/dns/verification.ts`
- [ ] T019 POST /api/dns/verify endpoint in `api/dns/verify.ts`
- [ ] T020 GET /api/dns/verify/[id] endpoint in `api/dns/verify/[id].ts`

### Enhanced Provider Status

- [ ] T021 Enhanced provider status service in `api/providers/status.ts`
- [ ] T022 GET /api/providers/status endpoint implementation
- [ ] T023 GET /api/providers/[provider]/status endpoint implementation
- [ ] T024 Provider health check enhancements in existing provider files

## Phase 3.4: Integration

### Deployment Pipeline Integration

- [ ] T025 DNS readiness check in Vercel deployment hook
- [ ] T026 Provider status monitoring integration
- [ ] T027 Health check endpoint enhancements in `api/health.ts`
- [ ] T028 Error handling and logging for DNS operations

### Edge Function Optimization

- [ ] T029 DNS verification caching strategy
- [ ] T030 Provider status caching in Edge runtime
- [ ] T031 Request rate limiting for DNS endpoints
- [ ] T032 CORS configuration for new endpoints

## Phase 3.5: Polish

### Testing and Validation

- [ ] T033 [P] Unit tests for DNS verification logic in `tests/unit/test_dns_verification.ts`
- [ ] T034 [P] Unit tests for enhanced provider status in `tests/unit/test_provider_status.ts`
- [ ] T035 [P] Performance tests for DNS verification (<5 minute propagation)
- [ ] T036 [P] Performance tests for provider status (<150ms response)

### Documentation and Monitoring

- [ ] T037 [P] Update API documentation in `docs/api.md` with DNS endpoints
- [ ] T038 [P] Update deployment documentation with DNS verification steps
- [ ] T039 [P] Add monitoring dashboard for DNS propagation metrics
- [ ] T040 [P] Add monitoring dashboard for provider status trends
- [ ] T041 Run manual testing scenarios from `specs/005-dns-deployment-fixes/quickstart.md`

## Dependencies

### Critical Path

- Setup (T001-T003) before all implementation
- Contract tests (T004-T007) before core implementation (T010-T024)
- Type fixes (T010-T014) before provider enhancements (T021-T024)
- DNS models (T015-T017) before DNS service (T018)
- DNS service (T018) before DNS endpoints (T019-T020)

### Implementation Order

- T010-T014 can run in parallel (different provider files)
- T015-T017 can run in parallel (same file, different interfaces)
- T019-T020 must be sequential (DNS verification dependency)
- T021-T024 depend on T010-T014 completion
- Integration (T025-T032) after core implementation complete
- Polish (T033-T041) can run in parallel after integration
