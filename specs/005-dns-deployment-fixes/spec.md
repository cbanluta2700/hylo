# Feature Specification: DNS & Deployment Fixes

**Branch**: `005-dns-deployment-fixes` | **Date**: 2025-01-17 | **Status**: In Progress

## Overview

Address DNS record update delays in Vercel deployments and resolve TypeScript compiler errors that are blocking production deployment of the Hylo Travel AI application.

## Problem Statement

1. **DNS Issues**: Vercel DNS record updates experiencing delays, causing deployment accessibility issues
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Strict TypeScript compliance violations in LLM provider status handling and multi-agent service index signature access
3. **Deployment Reliability**: Production hardening features merged but blocked by compilation errors

## User Stories

### Story 1: DNS Deployment Reliability

**As a** DevOps/deployment stakeholder  
**I want** reliable DNS propagation for Vercel deployments  
**So that** the application is accessible immediately after deployment without DNS delays

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- DNS records update within expected timeframes (< 5 minutes)
- Deployment process includes DNS verification steps
- Fallback strategies documented for DNS delays
- Monitoring in place for DNS propagation issues

### Story 2: TypeScript Compliance

**As a** developer working on the codebase  
**I want** all TypeScript errors resolved with strict mode compliance  
**So that** the application compiles successfully and maintains type safety

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Strict mode compliance maintained
- Provider status handling properly typed
- Index signature access follows TypeScript best practices
- No regression in type safety

### Story 3: Production Deployment Success

**As a** product owner  
**I want** successful production deployments with all features working  
**So that** users can access the travel AI application reliably

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Application deploys successfully to Vercel
- All LLM provider routing works correctly
- Multi-agent travel planning functionality operational
- No runtime errors related to type mismatches

## Functional Requirements

### DNS Management

- **REQ-DNS-001**: Implement DNS record verification in deployment pipeline
- **REQ-DNS-002**: Add DNS propagation monitoring and alerting
- **REQ-DNS-003**: Document DNS troubleshooting procedures
- **REQ-DNS-004**: Implement fallback domain strategies if needed

### TypeScript Compliance

- **REQ-TS-001**: Resolve ProviderStatus type conflicts between enum and interface
- **REQ-TS-002**: Fix index signature property access in multiAgentService.ts
- **REQ-TS-003**: Ensure strict TypeScript compliance across provider infrastructure
- **REQ-TS-004**: Maintain type safety while resolving compilation errors

### Deployment Pipeline

- **REQ-DEP-001**: Ensure production hardening features deploy correctly
- **REQ-DEP-002**: Validate LLM routing infrastructure in production
- **REQ-DEP-003**: Confirm error boundaries and resilience features work
- **REQ-DEP-004**: Test multi-provider fallback chains in deployment environment

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- DNS propagation verification adds < 30 seconds to deployment time
- TypeScript compilation time remains under 2 minutes
- No runtime performance degradation from type fixes

### Reliability

- 99.9% deployment success rate after DNS fixes
- Zero TypeScript compilation failures
- Graceful handling of DNS propagation delays

### Maintainability

- Clear documentation for DNS troubleshooting
- TypeScript patterns that are maintainable and follow best practices
- Monitoring and observability for deployment issues

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain constitutional compliance (edge-first, multi-LLM resilience, type safety)
- Cannot break existing LLM provider functionality
- Must work within Vercel platform limitations
- TypeScript strict mode must remain enabled

## Dependencies

- Vercel platform and DNS infrastructure
- Existing LLM provider implementations (Cerebras, Gemini, Groq)
- Production hardening features already merged
- LangChain.js multi-provider routing system

## Success Criteria

1. **Zero TypeScript compilation errors** in the entire codebase
2. **Successful Vercel deployment** with all features operational
3. **DNS records propagate within 5 minutes** of deployment
4. **All LLM providers respond correctly** in production environment
5. **Multi-agent travel planning works end-to-end** after deployment

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- DNS propagation delays could affect user access
- Type safety fixes might introduce runtime issues

### Medium Risk

- Vercel platform-specific DNS behavior
- Complex type relationships in provider infrastructure

### Low Risk

- Well-understood TypeScript compilation issues
- Existing error handling infrastructure

## Implementation Notes

- TypeScript errors are primarily in provider status handling and service property access
- DNS issues appear to be Vercel platform-specific, not application code issues
- Production hardening infrastructure is already in place and tested
- Constitutional compliance has been maintained throughout the codebase
