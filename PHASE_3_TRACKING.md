**Date**: September 21, 2025  
**Phase**: 3 of 5 - Endpoint Consolidation  
**Duration**: Day 3  
**Status**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**

---

## 📋 **PHASE 3 TASK CHECKLIST**

### **P3.1 - Infrastructure Consolidation**

- [ ] ⏳ Create `/api/system.ts` (health + DNS)
- [ ] ⏳ Create `/api/cache.ts` (vector operations)
- [ ] ⏳ Test consolidated endpoints
- [ ] ⏳ Remove old infrastructure endpoints

### **P3.2 - Workflow Integration**

- [ ] ⏳ Replace `/api/inngest.ts` with `/api/inngest-v2.ts`
- [ ] ⏳ Remove `/api/inngest/route.ts`
- [ ] ⏳ Remove `/api/search/providers.ts`
- [ ] ⏳ Integrate search orchestration into Inngest

### **P3.3 - Entry Point Updates**

- [ ] ⏳ Update `/api/itinerary/generate.ts` to use Inngest events
- [ ] ⏳ Update form endpoints to use events
- [ ] ⏳ Update status endpoints to query Inngest state

## 📊 **CURRENT PROGRESS: 0/11 TASKS COMPLETE (0%)**

**Starting**: 🔄 Infrastructure consolidation  
**Next Up**: ⏳ System endpoint creation  
**Goal**: 8-function architecture with consolidated endpoints

---

## 🎯 **PHASE 3 SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**

- [ ] Infrastructure consolidated from 4 endpoints to 2
- [ ] Old agent endpoints deleted (4 endpoints eliminated)
- [ ] Entry points updated to use Inngest events
- [ ] Search orchestration integrated into workflow
- [ ] All endpoints tested and working

### **TARGET ARCHITECTURE:**

```
api/
├── itinerary/
│   ├── generate.ts    ← Updated to send Inngest events
│   ├── status.ts      ← Updated to query Inngest state
│   ├── update.ts      ← Updated to send Inngest events
│   └── live.ts        ← Enhanced WebSocket + Inngest
├── inngest.ts         ← Replace with inngest-v2.ts
├── form/updates.ts    ← Keep, update to use events
├── cache.ts           ← NEW: Consolidated caching
└── system.ts          ← NEW: Health + DNS
```

## 🔥 **STARTING P3.1: INFRASTRUCTURE CONSOLIDATION**

**Current Task**: Creating consolidated system endpoint  
**Approach**: Merge health + DNS functionality into single endpoint  
**Target**: Reduce 4 infrastructure endpoints to 2
