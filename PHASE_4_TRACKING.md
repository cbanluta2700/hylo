## 📊 **CURRENT PROGRESS: 0/12 TASKS COMPLETE (0%)**

**Starting**: 🔄 Inngest Dev Server setup  
**Next Up**: ⏳ Workflow function testing  
**Goal**: Complete validation of event-driven architecture

---

## 🎯 **PHASE 4 SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**

- [ ] All workflow functions tested locally with Inngest Dev Server
- [ ] Event flow validated end-to-end (generate → status → completion)
- [ ] Client integration working with real-time progress updates
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show improvement over old architecture
- [ ] Vercel deployment successful with all functions under limits

### **TESTING OBJECTIVES:**

1. **Functional Testing**: All Inngest functions execute correctly
2. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow from API to completion
3. **Performance Testing**: Better performance than old architecture
4. **Error Testing**: Graceful handling of failures and retries
5. **Client Testing**: Frontend integration with WebSocket progress
6. **Deployment Testing**: Successful Vercel Edge deployment

## 🔥 **STARTING P4.1: LOCAL DEVELOPMENT TESTING**

**Current Task**: Setting up Inngest Dev Server  
**Approach**: Install and configure local Inngest development environment  
**Target**: Full local testing capability for all workflow functions

**Architecture Validation:**

```
8 Functions to Test:
├── api/inngest.ts (6 internal functions)
├── api/itinerary/generate.ts (event sender)
├── api/itinerary/status.ts (state query)
├── api/itinerary/update.ts
├── api/itinerary/live.ts
├── api/form/updates.ts
├── api/cache.ts
└── api/system.ts
```
