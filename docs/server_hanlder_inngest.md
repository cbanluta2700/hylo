**Exactly right!** That warning applies **only if you're running a full Express.js server**. Since you're using **Vercel with file-based API routes**, you **don't need to worry about `express.json()`**.

## 🎯 Clear Distinction

### If you WERE using a standalone Express server (not Vercel):

```typescript
// This is what the warning refers to - a traditional Express app
import express from 'express';
import { serve } from 'inngest/express';

const app = express();

// ⚠️ THIS would be required in a standalone Express app:
app.use(express.json({ limit: '10mb' })); // Must add this middleware

app.use('/api/inngest', serve({ client: inngest, functions: [generateSummary] }));

app.listen(3000);
```

### But you're using Vercel API routes (your current setup):

```typescript
// api/inngest/index.ts - YOUR ACTUAL SETUP
import { serve } from 'inngest/express';
import { inngest } from './client';
import { generateSummary } from './functions/generateSummary';

// ✅ NO express.json() needed here!
// Vercel handles the JSON parsing automatically for you
export default serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [generateSummary],
});
```

## 🔧 Why Vercel Handles This Differently

- **Vercel API routes** are pre-configured serverless functions that automatically handle JSON parsing
- **Standalone Express servers** require manual middleware configuration
- The `inngest/express` package works with **both** environments, but the setup differs

## 📋 Your Complete, Correct Setup

**Your current file structure is perfect:**

```
my-ai-app/
├── api/inngest/index.ts          # ✅ No express.json() needed
├── api/inngest/client.ts
├── api/inngest/functions/generateSummary.ts
└── src/ (Vite React frontend)
```

**Your `api/inngest/index.ts` should be:**

```typescript
import { serve } from 'inngest/express';
import { inngest } from './client';
import { generateSummary } from './functions/generateSummary';

// That's it! Vercel handles the rest automatically
export default serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [generateSummary],
});
```

## 🚨 When WOULD You Need to Worry About This?

Only if you later decide to:

- Deploy your backend as a standalone Express server (not on Vercel)
- Use a different hosting provider that requires manual Express setup
- Migrate from Vercel API routes to a custom Express server

**For your current Vite + Vercel setup, you can safely ignore the `express.json()` warning.**

The documentation includes that warning because the `inngest/express` package is designed to work in multiple environments, but your specific Vercel deployment handles the JSON parsing automatically.

So you're good to go with your current structure!
