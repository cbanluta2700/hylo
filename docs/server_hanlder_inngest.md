## ðŸ”§ Why Vercel Handles This Differently

- **Vercel API routes** are pre-configured serverless functions that automatically handle JSON parsing
- **Standalone Express servers** require manual middleware configuration
- The `inngest/express` package works with **both** environments, but the setup differs

## ðŸ“‹ Your Complete, Correct Setup

**Your current file structure is perfect:**

```
my-ai-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/inngest/index.ts          # âœ… No express.json() needed
â”œâ”€â”€ api/inngest/client.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ api/inngest/functions/generateSummary.ts
â””â”€â”€ src/ (Vite React frontend)
```

**Your `api/inngest/index.ts` should be:**

```typescript
import { serve } from 'inngest/express';
import { inngest } from './client';
import { generateSummary } from './functions/generateSummary';

// That's it! Vercel handles the rest automatically
export default serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [generateSummary],
});
```

## ðŸš¨ When WOULD You Need to Worry About This?

Only if you later decide to:

- Deploy your backend as a standalone Express server (not on Vercel)
- Use a different hosting provider that requires manual Express setup
- Migrate from Vercel API routes to a custom Express server

**For your current Vite + Vercel setup, you can safely ignore the `express.json()` warning.**

The documentation includes that warning because the `inngest/express` package is designed to work in multiple environments, but your specific Vercel deployment handles the JSON parsing automatically.

So you're good to go with your current structure!
