## Context7 MCP Integration Patterns Used

### LangGraph StateGraph Implementation
```typescript
// Based on Context7 latest patterns for multi-agent orchestration
import { StateGraph, END } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const createWorkflowGraph = () => {
  const workflow = new StateGraph(WorkflowState);
  
  // Add agent nodes with Context7 streaming patterns
  workflow.addNode("content_planner", contentPlannerAgent);
  workflow.addNode("info_gatherer", infoGathererAgent);
  workflow.addNode("strategist", strategistAgent);
  workflow.addNode("compiler", compilerAgent);
  
  // Context7-recommended conditional edges
  workflow.addConditionalEdges(
    "content_planner",
    determineNextAgent,
    {
      "info_gatherer": "info_gatherer",
      "end": END
    }
  );
  
  return workflow.compile();
};
```

### Streaming Response Patterns
```typescript
// Context7 streaming implementation for real-time updates
async function* streamWorkflowProgress(workflow: CompiledWorkflow) {
  for await (const chunk of workflow.stream(initialState)) {
    yield {
      status: chunk.status,
      progress: calculateProgress(chunk),
      data: chunk.data,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
  }
}
```

### Agent Communication Protocols
```typescript
// Context7 Command pattern for agent orchestration
interface AgentCommand {
  nextAgent: string;
  confidence: number;
  data: any;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}

const executeAgent = async (state: WorkflowState): Promise<AgentCommand> => {
  // Context7 structured output pattern
  const result = await llm.invoke(prompt, {
    response_format: zodToJsonSchema(AgentCommandSchema)
  });
  
  return AgentCommandSchema.parse(result);
};
```
