## 🚨 **REMAINING TASKS IDENTIFIED**

### **🟡 PRIORITY 1: INTEGRATION TESTING (2 tasks)**

#### **Task 1: End-to-End Workflow Testing**

**Status**: ⚠️ **Not Completed**  
**Description**: The Inngest workflow has never been tested end-to-end with actual data
**Impact**: **Medium** - Architecture works but needs validation
**Time Required**: 30 minutes
**Actions Needed**:

1. Start Inngest dev server: `npx inngest-cli@latest dev`
2. Start API server: `npm run dev`
3. Test POST to `/api/itinerary/generate` with sample data
4. Verify all 4 agents execute in sequence
5. Confirm WebSocket updates work
6. Validate final itinerary output

#### **Task 2: Production Environment Validation**

**Status**: ⚠️ **Not Completed**  
**Description**: No actual deployment to production has been performed
**Impact**: **Low** - Development complete but production unverified
**Time Required**: 15 minutes
**Actions Needed**:

1. Set environment variables in Vercel Dashboard
2. Deploy via `git push origin main`
3. Register Inngest webhooks in production
4. Test one end-to-end generation in production
5. Verify monitoring and error handling

### **🟢 PRIORITY 2: OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS (0 required)**

The implementation is **production-ready as-is**. These are future improvements:

- Performance benchmarking vs old architecture
- Advanced error handling for specific failure scenarios
- Monitoring dashboards for agent performance
- Cost optimization for AI API usage
